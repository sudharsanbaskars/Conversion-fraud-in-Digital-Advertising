### About Problem Statement
Digital Advertising is changing at a rapid pace with a huge increase in digital audience. At the same time, the digital advertising success metric is shifting from audience volume (eg. Impression count) to conversions (eg. lead submissions) as the success metric. This requires higher transparency and control on the conversions.

Colombia, the digital advertising arm of Times Internet Limited has seen significant growth in its digital advertising inventory. It wants to ensure that in all its conversion-based campaigns, no unfair advantage is given to the publishers generating fake leads.

Your task is to segregate the test data between genuine and false conversions by identifying the maximum possible leads generated by the malignant technique.
