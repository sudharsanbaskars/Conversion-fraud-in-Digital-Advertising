This repository contains a notebook and datasets which I have created for a particular Virtual Machine Learning hackathon.
I have got an accuray around 89.8901.

### About Hackathon
This is a Virtual Machine Learning Hackathon conducted by code Gladiators 2021 presented by cognizant.
This hackathon is to multi-categorize items with high precision. NLP is a domain which is so old but still too much to explore. WIth this hackathon we want to identify potential solutions that have the scalability as well as the performance required for a production system. How easily deployable is the solution is a plus.

### About Problem Statement
Digital Advertising is changing at a rapid pace with a huge increase in digital audience. At the same time, the digital advertising success metric is shifting from audience volume (eg. Impression count) to conversions (eg. lead submissions) as the success metric. This requires higher transparency and control on the conversions.

Colombia, the digital advertising arm of Times Internet Limited has seen significant growth in its digital advertising inventory. It wants to ensure that in all its conversion-based campaigns, no unfair advantage is given to the publishers generating fake leads.

Your task is to segregate the test data between genuine and false conversions by identifying the maximum possible leads generated by the malignant technique.
